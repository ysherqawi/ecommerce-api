## Credits
I watched the api creation part from course:
MERN Stack React Node Ecommerce from Scratch to Deployment

I used what i've learned in previous courses and updated it to use async-await and promises instead of callbacks and write a cleaner code, adding more features like reviews, forgot password, reset password , improve security
and better folders structures
